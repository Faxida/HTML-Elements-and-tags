      <h2>Three things I enjoy</h2>

        <h3> Music </h3>

        <p>Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and
          timbre.[1][2] It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies. General definitions of
          music
          include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated
          concepts
          tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and
          texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may
          emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments
          and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal
          pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.
          The
          word derives from Greek μουσική (mousiké; "(art) of the Muses").[3] </p>
        <p>In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the
          creation of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the
          history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined
          music
          in two parts: melodies, as tones ordered horizontally, and harmonies as tones ordered vertically. Common
          sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is
          often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can
          be music, saying, for example, "There is no noise, only sound."[4]

          The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and
          social
          context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being
          music", including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge string quartet in 1825,[5] early jazz in the beginning of the
          1900s[6] and hardcore punk in the 1980s.[7] There are many types of music, including popular music,
          traditional music, art music, music written for religious ceremonies, and work songs such as chanteys. Music
          ranges from strictly organized compositions—such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and
          1800s—through to spontaneously played improvisational music such as jazz, and avant-garde styles of
          chance-based contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries. </p>

        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant,
          animal or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins,
          or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide
          energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours
          that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within
          specific geographical contexts. </p>
        <p>Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems.
          Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. As
          agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the
          agriculture opportunities in their geography. Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of
          numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and
          dishes. As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have
          become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange
          of different food traditions and practices. </p>

        <h3>People</h3>
        <p>A people is any plurality of persons considered as a whole.</p>
        <p>I love people, all people in general, why ? Because they are all different, different looks, different sizes,
          different heights and so many different personalities.</p>
        <p>What I love most about people is the way they smile.</p>
