    About me
</h1>
<p>
    My name is Fabi√®nne, I'm 41 years old and live in Amsterdam.
    I love music, good food and people.
    I'm taking this course to find out if webdesign is something I could get into.
    I don't like taking pictures so I don't even have that many, but here's a nice picture of a random person being happy!:
    <p>
    <img src="./happiness.jpg" width="200" title="picture of happy person" alt="Picture of a random person that looks happy." >
</p>
    Well that's enough about me.
